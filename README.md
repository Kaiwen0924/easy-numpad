# Easy Numpad
Easy Numpad is a pure HTML+JS+CSS control to implement a Numeric Pad in your HTML page, to be associated in a very simple way with any text field.

Based on a Fork from an original project by [Gayan Sandamal](https://github.com/gayanSandamal/easy-numpad).

I'm modifying the code to use only Javascript without external frameworks (_no JQuery required_), in order to improve compatibility with all browsers and improve performance.

# Try it

You can see a live example of use [in this page](https://bobboteck.github.io/easy-numpad/index.html).

# How to use in your page
Simple add this code where you need, every time you need in your HTML page:
```
<input id="yourElementId" type="number" readonly="true" onclick="show_easy_numpad(this);" />
```
you need only to replace "yourElementId" with the specific ID of your control.

If you need to set a default value, just value the "value" property of the element, as shown in the following example where 125 is the default value:
```
<input id="yourElementId" type="number" value="125" readonly="true" onclick="show_easy_numpad(this);" />
```

Now you can set a range of value with standard min and max attribute of tag as show in the following example:
```
<input id="yourElementId" type="number" min="-12.5" max="30" readonly="true" onclick="show_easy_numpad(this);" />
```

# Added a new feature
A list of new features implemented respect to the original:

- When selecting an input field already valued, the value is also shown in the easy-numpad that opens
- Added a "Â±" button to type negative numbers, and now only a "-" sign can be inserted in the head of number
- Enter the "0" automatically if the "." is pressed first
- Enter the "." automatically if the "0" is pressed first
- ~~Validation of the number entered~~ implicit validation with the controls made on the insertion
- Manage the insertion of an excessive number of characters
- Manage *min* and *max* range with standard attribute of tag
